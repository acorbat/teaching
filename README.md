# Teaching Examples

The main purpose of this package will be to save different teaching examples 
that are frequently required to understand several topics.

## Goodness-of-Fit

Models are usually developed to acquire an understanding over reality. These 
models should describe results from experiments. How do we compare which model 
is best at describing the experiment? How can we test if a fitting of a model 
has been performed accordingly? What about over or underestimating errors?
